# Smart City Platform

This project is a front-end implementation of a Smart City platform built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The platform is designed to enhance citizen engagement by providing convenient access to a wide range of city services, local news, community events, issue reporting and tracking, emergency alerts, and an interactive map. The platform also includes visually appealing animations and modal-based user interactions.

## Features

- **Services Section**: A detailed grid view of city services, including utilities, transportation, education, health, and waste management.
- **Interactive UI**: Hover effects, responsive design, and animations to improve user experience.
- **Footer Section**: Includes links to social media, privacy policies, terms of service, and a credits section.
- **Custom Animations**: Modern animations and transitions for buttons and modals to enhance the visual experience.
- **Dark Mode Support**: The platform supports dark mode to cater to different user preferences.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including Flexbox and Grid for layout design.
- **Bootstrap**: For a responsive grid system and pre-designed components.
- **JavaScript**: For functionality, including modal interactions and dynamic content loading.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons used in the services section.


## Future Enhancements

- **Back-End Integration**: Connect the platform to a back-end server for processing service requests and user data.
- **Interactive Map**: Add a static map with dynamic arrows pointing to event or news locations across the city.
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time emergency alerts for citizens.
- **Enhanced Responsiveness**: Further refine the platform for mobile devices.
